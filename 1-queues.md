# Queues

## Definition
- A queue follows a certain order. It follows the principle of
FIFO (First In First Out). (See Model Below) A good way to 
think of this is to picture a grocery store line, once one 
customer comes in line, they are first to go. When another 
customer comes in line, they are in a queue to get to 
the front.
