# Queues

## Definition
- A queue follows a certain order. It follows the principle of
FIFO (First In First Out). (See Model Below) A good way to 
think of this is to picture a grocery store line, once one 
customer comes in line, they are first to go. When another 
customer comes in line, they are in a queue to get to 
the front. 

### Enqueue and Dequeue
- Enqueue = An item will be added to the queue
- Dequeue = An item will be removed from the queue

## Big O Notation
- When it comes to big o notation, it has several factors. For example, in access or search, it will often have o(n). And for insertion and deletion, it will have o(1).

## Example
- For this example, we will we use queues in the setting of a morning routine. 
 
        `queue_ex=[]`

        `queue_ex.append('Wake up')`

        `queue_ex.append('Brush teeth')`

        `queue_ex.append('Take Shower')`

        `print("Queue:")`

        `print(queue_ex)`

## Try It Out!
- After looking at the provided example, make a night routine with information provided: Brush teeth, Go to sleep, Fluff pillow, Floss. Put this in order of what you think the correct order should be!
