## Definition
- A set is a data type that can store data values. With this in mind, there are no repeated values nor does it have any order.

## Example
- For this example we will add values to a set. This will store their values and keep track of it.

        `example_set`

        `{10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}`

        `example_set.add(9)`- This will add the value to our set and store it.

        `print(example_set)`

        `{9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}`


## Try It Out!
- For this problem, we will use the same style with numbers and create a set of your own to complete the set. You need to find out which numbers are missing and add them!
The values are (24, 30, 26,)
